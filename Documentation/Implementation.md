# Implementation Decision

We are using python for this problem. Python gives us access to some powerful AI tools. Python is also a strong tool for tackling the problems of AI. With the state space of the problem to be an array of gears. The array of gears will contain information on how the other gears turn and what the current position of the gears is.

Currently the UI uses TKinter as the framework. This was chosen as it was quick to setup and run the UI. Furthermore the UI is simple and displays information about the turns. Easy to add more features but also easy to replace the UI with a different UI that could function the same way. The functionality of the algorithms is well separated and should be easy to use with a different UI.
